# A1_3_7 For Loops

## Activity Submission
Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to take down one of the following high priority targets: 

### Hangman
Step 11j outlines the parameters for creating a function to run a simple hangman game. 

### Lottery
Step 11k outlines the parameters for creating a function to run a lottery ticket checker. 

### Mastermind
Step 11l outlines the parameters for creating a function to mimic the classic game *Mastermind. 

### Hi Lo Guessing Game
Continue working on the function for our hi lo guessing game. 

You will need to figure out a way to complete the following:
1. Allow the user to make more than one guess.
2. Limit the total amount of times the user is allowed to guess. 
*hint: you need to have the user input a guess BEFORE and AFTER the guess has been evaluated. 

Once you have completed one of the above you need to commit a Python script to your own branch. 
*this requires that you download your notebook as a python doc - make sure it is in the correct repository. 

You may complete another mission or move on once one submission has been made. 
*each addtional submission requires its OWN python doc.
